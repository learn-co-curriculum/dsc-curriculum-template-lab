***This is the template for creating a LAB for Data Science. Please make sure to change the title to the appropriate topic and leave the `- Lab` to indicate that this is a lab. Next add an introduction, objectives (which should be taken from the lab's outlined SWBATS), the lab's content, and summary.***

> Note: All labs should have **Instructions:** that give a stepped flow to the lab's content. 
* Instructions should be be specific. Students shouldn't have to make assumptions about what to do based on the instructions, they should immediately know.  
* Instructions should be written in order of how to approach the lab. If you need to build a class before you can define any methods, the instructions should lead the student to build the class first.
